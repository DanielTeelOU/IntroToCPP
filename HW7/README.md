# Homework 7
## Question 1
Define a class called Month that is an abstract data type for a month. Your class will have one member variable of type int to represent a month (1 for January, 2 for February, and so forth). Include all the following member functions: a constructor to set the month using the first three letters in the name of the month as three arguments, a constructor to set the month using an integer as an argument (1 for January, 2 for February, and so forth), a default constructor, an input function that reads the month as an integer, an input function that reads the month as the first three letters in the name of the month, an output function that outputs the month as an integer, an output function that outputs the month as the first three letters in the name of the month, and a member function that returns the next month as a value of type Month . Embed your class definition in a test program.

## Question 2
Redefine the implementation of the class Month described in Question 1. This time the month is implemented as three member variables of type char that store the first three letters in the name of the month. Embed your definition in a test program.

## Question 3
My mother always took a little red counter to the grocery store. The counter was used to keep tally of the amount of money she would have spent so far on that visit to the store if she bought everything in the basket. The counter had a four-digit display, increment buttons for each digit, and a reset button. An overflow indicator came up red if more money was entered than the $99.99 it would register. (This was a long time ago.)<br/>
Write and implement the member functions of a class Counter that simulates and slightly generalizes the behavior of this grocery store counter. The constructor should create a Counter object that can count up to the constructor’s argument. That is, Counter(9999) should provide a counter that can count up to 9999 . A newly constructed counter displays a reading of 0 . The member function void reset( ); sets the counter’s number to 0 . The member function void incr1( ); increments the units digits by 1 , void incr10( ); increments the tens digit by 1 , and void incr100( ); and void incr1000( ); increment the next two digits, respectively. Accounting for any carrying when you increment should require no further action than adding an appropriate number to the private data member. A member function bool overflow( ); detects overflow. (Overflow is the result of incrementing the counter’s private data member beyond the maximum entered at counter construction.)<br/>
Use this class to provide a simulation of my mother’s little red clicker. Even though the display is an integer, in the simulation, the rightmost (lower order) two digits are always thought of as cents and tens of cents, the next digit is dollars, and the fourth digit is tens of dollars.<br/>
Provide keys for cents, dimes, dollars, and tens of dollars. Unfortunately, no choice of keys seems particularly mnemonic. One choice is to use the keys asdfo: a for cents, followed by a digit 1 to 9 ; s for dimes, followed by a digit 1 to 9 ; d for dollars, followed by a digit 1 to 9 ; and f for tens of dollars, again followed by a digit 1 to 9 . Each entry (one of asdf followed by 1 to 9) is followed by pressing the Return key. Any overflow is reported after each operation. Overflow can be requested by pressing the o key.<br/>
