# Midterm Coding Questions

## Question 4
If possible:
*Write two functions with the same name swapValues. Each function takes two parameters and swaps their values.
*The first swapValues function takes two integers as parameters. The second swapValues function takes two booleans as parameters.
If not possible:
*Explain why it is not possible to write these two functions.

## Question 5
Write a function called sumSquares that takes an array of integer and loops through all the elements of the array. For each element the function computes the square of the element. The function also calculates and returns the sum of these squared numbers.
Note that
* Your code must use a while loop. Other forms of loop are not accepted.
* Your code must be robust.

## Question 6
Write a function called least2 that takes a parameter called arr which is an array of integers and finds and prints the smallest two numbers in arr. 
For example, if least2 is invoked with arr={8, 11, 9, 3} it will print two numbers 3 and 8 as the smallest two numbers in arr.
Note that
* the size of the array arr is unknown.
* arr is the only parameter of least2.
* the smallest two numbers do not need to be returned from your function. Just printing them is sufficient.
* Your code should be robust. An example of the corner case is a case in which findings two smallest numbers may not be possible, due to the size of the array, etc.
